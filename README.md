# CMDS-applied-project
This project proposes the development of a systematic, OSINT-based framework to identify, assess, and map the capabilities and intent of cyber threat actors targeting specific activity sectors or organizations.
Data Collection
- identify and store a large number of open-source CTI reports (PDF, HTML, text);
Data parsing (text) and entity extraction
- apply NLP techniques to extract threat actors, campaigns, target sectors, TTPs,
vulnerabilities;
Correlate extracted entities using and display using a graphical method
- build a heterogeneous graph linking threat actors to targets and capabilities;
- compute intent scores based on historical targeting of similar organizations or
sectors;
- compute opportunity/ capability scores based on actor capabilities.
Objectives:
- develop a scoring methodology for intent and opportunity related to cyber threat
actors;
- provide a repeatable method that could be applied in different organizations or
activity sectors;
- demonstrate that open source data and information can be used in a meaningful
way in order to adjust or modify risk assessments or decision makling processes.
